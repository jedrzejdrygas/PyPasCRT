# PyPasCRT 

Simple app in Python 2.7 + Pygame 
It allows you to draw with your mouse WYSIWYG and converts your drawing into Pascal code using Pascal's CRT library. 
The pygame window is divided into 80 x 24 rectangles and each pixel when mouse event occurs on it writes line of code to an list saying its coordinates and color which has been selected. At the exit array is written to "Program.pas" text file where it becomes propper Pascal program.

Written only to fool around with school teacher which gave us assignment to draw in Pascal using CRT library. Thanks to this without prior coding knowledge you could fulfill that assignment.
